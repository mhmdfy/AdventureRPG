The wizard game:
- Third person controller (wasd to move)
- Tap to target (and change target)
- Abilities are the numbers 1-4, or clicking the buttons
- Win condition is to get 100 points (score)

NOTE: Models and sounds weren't made by me. I got them from the following sites:
- http://thefree3dmodels.com/stuff for the models
- http://www.flashkit.com/soundfx/ for the sound effects
- Soundtrack is from Final Fantasy XI CD that I got from my roommate.
